This file contains sample versions of sim_out

For simplicity, all samples used the same sim_input, the one in this file.
Although the program has been tested and still runs properly with other
sim_input files

sim_out_A_1 means output for `./lift_sim_A 1 t`,
sim_out_B_5 means output for `./lift_sim_B 1 t`,
and so on.
